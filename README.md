I like good food, bad puns, green limes, and imagining that I'm good at dancing. I study computer science and am currently enrolled in S1 of B. Tech. When I'm not busy laughing at bad jokes, I can be found complaining about phantom problems with my PC that appear only when I use it (I have a magic touch, obviously).

## My Experience

It took no longer than a few days after the challenge was posted for me to barrel down the path of procrastination. If there is anything the last three days before the deadline taught me, it is that I always forget just how much I enjoy learning to code, and how the small wins I gain from the process feel. I am grateful to these tasks for providing me with an opportunity to remind myself of the things I love doing. My takeaway from this challenge is that I must learn to put some pressure on myself early on, and to take my own deadlines seriously, so I can enjoy myself as much as I have the potential to.

## What I Expect (of Myself)

As time permits, I will be revisiting some of the tasks to optimise the code, stylise those with a GUI, and debug to remove the errors I missed the first time around.  I intend to continue trying some more of the tasks at my leisure (although I am convinced that I get almost no work done without a deadline looming over me). I thoroughly learned a lot of new things from the tasks that I did do, and hope to update my post-submission progress in a separate table.
