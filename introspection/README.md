# Introspection

### Q.  Why must we choose you?
Well... "must" is a strong word. I myself am yet to find out how efficient a worker I can be, but I am prepared and ready to take on some challenges. Maybe it won't work out in the end, but I am not too concerned about what hasn't happened yet. I have a dream without a direction, and I am only hoping that being with like-minded people will set me on a well-informed path to education.
    
### Q.  What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I have a couple of personal utility projects that I have lined up to work on for the next few months. I intend to introduce myself to a variety of tools and libraries required to get these projects completed, and along the way learn to increase my pace as well. I also hope to get some experience coding with different languages to find my groove and discover the one I feel most keen to work with.

### Q. How would you contribute back to the club?
I believe that one of my biggest strengths is my inclination to give as much as I take, which is an interest that strongly aligns with the principles of open source. I find it deeply fulfilling to share with my peers what I know, and to learn from them what I do not. For a community like amFOSS to continue advancing at a competent pace, collaboration is a requirement that I might excel at.

### Q. Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
For obvious reasons, I feel that the Praveshan challenge would be better without task #02 - Star all amFOSS Repositories. While I understand that it is almost tradition at this point, amFOSS has the nationwide reputation of being the best open source coding club in the country and does not need the extra stars. I found the rest of the challenge to be well-crafted and excellent at providing an introduction to a variety of platforms that I otherwise would likely not have explored on my own in the near future. It was as enjoyable as it was educational to try them. I'd highly recommend anyone with half an interest in coding to try these tasks, as they are versatile in their reach but not so complex that it would tire a novice out easily.
