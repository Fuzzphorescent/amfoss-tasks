# Programming

## The Fastest Way to Cast A Spell

This is the first challenge I tried. Writing this code got much easier once I realised that C++ by default is able to accept two inputs on the same line separated by a blank space. I had been writing multiple functions to input, split and store the strings as an array which was only made more painful by the fact that C++ stores strings as a character array. When I realised I did not have to be working with three-dimensional arrays, the program could be completed in just a couple lines of code.

## Journey to Jotenheim

This took only a few minutes to write, however I am not convinced that I have the most efficient solution. 

## Shrink to Win

My code had failed one test case on the first submission, but passed it when I rewrote it in Python. I figured the issue had to do with data types, and changed the variables from `int` to `long long int` to accommodate the input range.

Only three of the ten available challenges have been completed. The first challenge I tried overwhelmed me enough to put off trying this task again until the day right before the deadline, by which point I could only complete two more. The problems that I did try were all fairly simple.
