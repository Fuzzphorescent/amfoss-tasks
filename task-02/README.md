# Terminal Hunt

A treasure hunt designed to familiarise the seeker with the terminal and git commands. 

This task was not a challenge as I was already familiar with the basic Linux commands. More time was spent writing the [SOLUTION.md](SOLUTION.md) file than was spent finding the key. As a rookie, this was the perfect fuss-free and non-intimidating task to start off my Praveshan journey with.
